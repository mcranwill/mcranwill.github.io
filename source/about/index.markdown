My name is Mike Cranwill and some of my passions are Software Engineering (especially architecture), travelling, Crossfit, and lifelong learning.

I graduated from Coe College in Cedar Rapids, IA May 2014 with Bachelors of Arts degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics with a Minor in Classical Studies.  I decided to pursue the liberal arts education experience to develop myself as a holistic student with primary focus in Computer Science.

Currently, I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Technology in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University out of Pittsburgh, PA.  I am pursuing this via the distance education program to further increase my understanding of software engineering techniques and especially software architecture.

Staying healthy has always been important to me but I have taken an even more active role as I have found a workout program I truely enjoy.  Crossfit incorporates my favorite parts of olympic weightlifting with great mobility and cardio training.  Thanks to [Renton Crossfit](https://twitter.com/RentonCrossFit) and [Loe Rider](https://twitter.com/loerider) for the great introductory training. They offer a sweet [Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/deals/renton-city-crossfit) to get started by the way.
