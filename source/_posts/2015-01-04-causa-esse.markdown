This is first real post detailing the Causa Esse ("Reason to be") of this blog.
As I am now starting my graduate student career, I plan to make a thoughtful attempt to document the interesting
topics, questions, and problems which I come across in as cogent and consistent way as possible.  Hence, the most
modern solution to this is blogging.

Topics to be covered (including but not limited to): Software Engineering Principles, gamification techniques, 
reviews of software and mobile apps, Crossfit experiences, and travel experiences.

I am very excited to enter on this journey for the duration of at least 2015.

Best Regards,
PulchraVita
